# Test_assigment
Checks mandatory fields.
Mandatory fields are marked with red solid border.
If some of mandatory fields is empty, on "Submit" clicking will be showed alert, where are written all missing fields. Missing fields will be marked with pink color.
Two checkboxes are optional.
In case of all mandatory fields aren't empty, will be showed alert that everything is alright, then page will be reloaded.
To perform a task was used jQuery with regular CSS and HTML.
Form was tested only in Google Chrome browser, so the result in other browsers may be different. Later I can test in other browsers and fix problems if they are.

For the purpose of experiment tried to use jQuery and Vue.js together
Didn't create script file to not switch between files to get information about fields
